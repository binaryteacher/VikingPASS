# VikingPASS
PASS _ Portable Answer Sheet Scanner
version beta2


VikingPASS  will only work with the 50 question, one page answer sheet.
(although it will scan any sheet from 1 to 50 questions)
A pdf of the answer sheet to be used is provided as well as a png file.
You are welcome to modify the logo at the upper right of the answer sheet.
The size and positioning and color (b/w) of this logo should remain consistent with the current NN 
since it is used to detect if an answer-sheet is upside down.
ANY OTHER MODIFICATIONS to the png could cause errors with the scanning process.

You are also free to replace the logo150x150.png with a 150x150 png from your school.
The file name should remain logo150x150.png

### Running VikingPASS:

It is recommended you paste your answer key from a single spreadsheet column of any length 1 to 50 
where each cell contains the letters A thru E for the answer to each question of the test to be scanned.
Scanning does allow for multiple answers for each question: no spaces, commas or other symbols are allowed.
Click submit and begin scanning tests.

For best results, have your face in the oval and manuever the test into the red rectangle 
making sure the answer sheet guide squares are aligned with the onscreen red squares.

### key actions:

the 'f' key to toggle face detection ... 

(with face detection on, a test will not scan if a face is not detected near the oval)

Press the 'a' key to display the animation tutorial to aid in guiding the answer sheet.

Press the '+' and '-' keys while holding a test in the red scan area to adjust the scan threshold if needed.

Press the 'q' key or Escape to exit the program.

At any time while using the app or after closing it, you can view the saved scan images to view the scores
of each test and a representation of the scan in the directory created with the date and time 
that the app was launched. You may delete these at any time and are soley for your reference and record keeping.
They are not used for any subsequent executions of VikingPASS.

Thank you and we hope you enjoy your experience using VikingPASS!
